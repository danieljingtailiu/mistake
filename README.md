This is a Chrome Extensions to help LeetCode users keep track of the LeetCode questions they would like to re-do in the future.

After users specified time period, the extension will remind the users to re-do the LeetCode question selected.

### Q: Why didn't I use the "add to list" feature from LeetCode?
A: I would like to sort the questions by the time when it was added, and give me an alert when my reminder time is up, to re-do this LeetCode question. I didn't find any similar feature from "add to list", so I created a chrome extension for this specific feature.

## User Installation

Install the extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetcode-mistake-tracker/gdkafhifmmkcifpdcfbppiieckgfpjbb)
